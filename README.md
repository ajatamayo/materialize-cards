# materialize-cards
Wordpress Plugin: Display images with captions as Materialize Cards

Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of different types of objects. Theyâ€™re also well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions can vary considerably, like photos with captions of variable length.

When the `caption` shortcode is used, the image will be displayed as a Materialize Card Image as specified here http://next.materializecss.com/cards.html
